# Expectation-Maximization on Gaussian Mixture Models  
This program implements a desktop GUI using Tkinter libraries in Python. The purpose of the GUI is to allow the user to input a .csv file containing data which they would like to perform the EM algorithm on. The application will then create a scatterplot for each of the features in the dataset with the corresponding GMM clusters plotted over them.  

## Download:  
Download [GMM.zip]() and extract the contents to a folder  

## Run:  
Run [GMM.bat](GMM.bat)  

## Usage:  
Application takes one .csv file at a time, click "browse files" and select the file, a new window will then pop up containing the output graphs.
